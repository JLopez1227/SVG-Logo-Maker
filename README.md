# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description
In this assignment, we were tasked with making a SVG logo maker. To do this we had to require `fs` and the `inquirer` packages. With these packages I was then able to make an array of prompts that will show up in the command line. I then had to write a function that would then generate and SVG Logo with the answers provided.

## Getting Started
To use this application you first want to clone my GitHub Repository onto your local computer. Then, you want to open the intergrated termial and run `npm i`. After running `npm i` you can then run `node index.js` to start up the application. You'll answer the questions and upon finishing that you should see and newly generated SVG file. You'll want to install the SVG Preview extension in VS Code, after installing it, you'll right click your newly generated SVG file and open the preview. You'll then be able to see your newly generated SVG logo!
